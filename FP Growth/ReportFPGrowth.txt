1. Importing the dataset using CSV reader from pandas library.
2. Assigning threshold support and calculating minimum support count from it.
3. Finding frequency of each item in the transactions.
4. Removing all items which have frequency less than the min. support count.
5. Ordering remaining items in descending order of frequencies.
6. Removing all non-supported items from each transaction and ordering remaining items in the above 
    defined order.
7. Inserting all transactions into the FP tree.
8. Mining for frequent itemsets from the FP tree.
